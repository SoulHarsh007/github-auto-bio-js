# github-auto-bio-js

A ready package to auto update GitHub biography! Inspired by Androz2091!  

## Getting started  
  
### Clone this repository  

### [Github] Create your personal access token  
  
You have to create a **personal access token**, to allow your app to update your biography. Click [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) to go to the personal access token creation page. Select the `User` field (Update all user data) and click `Generate new token`. Copy and paste it in your **config.json** file (`token` field).  
  
### [OpenWeatherMap] Get your application key  
  
You have to get your **openweathermap.org api key**, to allow your app to get the weather of your favourite city. Register [here](https://openweathermap.org/home/sign_up), then go on [your dashboard](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) to get your key. Copy and paste it in your **config.json** file (`weather` field).  
  
### That's it  

Now install the dependencies using `npm install` command.
Now start the script by using `npm start` or `node index.js`.  
Congratulations! your github bio will now update every 5 minutes! Feel free to open an issue if necessary!
